BASIC FILE ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
Design a program that can encrypt anddecrypt text files. You can use simplealgorithms like Caesar cipher for this project.
The Caesar Cipher is a monoalphabetic rotation cipher used by Gaius Julius Caesar. Caesar rotated each letter of the plaintext forward three times to encrypt, so that A became D, B became E, etc.
“ATTACK AT DAWN” encrypts to “DWWDFN DW GDZQ” using the Caesar Cipher. Note that rotating three letters is arbitrary; any number of letters (other than 26, assuming an English alphabet) may be rotated for the same effect.
The Shift Cipher
Also known as the Caesar cipher, the shift cipher is one that anyone can readily understand and remember for decoding. It is a form of the substitution cipher. By shifting the alphabet a few positions in either direction, a simple sentence can become unreadable to casual inspection.
