BASIC FILE ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
Design a program that can encrypt anddecrypt text files. You can use simplealgorithms like Caesar cipher for this project.
The Caesar Cipher is a monoalphabetic rotation cipher used by Gaius Julius Caesar. Caesar rotated each letter of the plaintext forward three times to encrypt, so that A became D, B became E, etc.
“ATTACK AT DAWN” encrypts to “DWWDFN DW GDZQ” using the Caesar Cipher. Note that rotating three letters is arbitrary; any number of letters (other than 26, assuming an English alphabet) may be rotated for the same effect.
The Shift Cipher
Also known as the Caesar cipher, the shift cipher is one that anyone can readily understand and remember for decoding. It is a form of the substitution cipher. By shifting the alphabet a few positions in either direction, a simple sentence can become unreadable to casual inspection.
TO-DO LIST APPLICATION
Build a console-based to-do list application.Users should be able to add tasks, mark them ascompleted, and view their current tasks.
Definition: A to-do list is a list of items that need to be completed. The items on the list can range from simple activities like replying to an email, to more complex tasks like creating project briefs.
A task is an object with an associated program and thread of control.
thread control :-
In a process, a thread refers to a single sequential activity being executed. these activities are also known as thread of execution or thread control. Now, any operating system process can execute a thread. we can say, that a process can have multiple threads.
